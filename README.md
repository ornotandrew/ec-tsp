# EC-TSP

An Evolutionary Algorithm to solve the symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as efficiently and effectively as possible. That is, finding
a minimal tour length in the least number of generations.

The EA uses the following parameter constraints:
+ Number of cities n = 1000.
+ One EA run = 100 generations.
+ Number of EA runs = 50

This was completed for an Evolutionary Computation (EC) assignment for Computer Science Honours 2015 at the University of Cape Town.
